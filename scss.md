A quick reminder on how to share your project with Seniormedia team when working with Scss/Sass projects

* Line break after calling an html element (tag, class ...)
* No call identifier, use a class for style (id reserved for javascript)
* respected the alphabetical order for the css values (font-family, color, cursor, background ...)
* 3 nests maximum
* A class can not be called more than once in the document
* Do not use the all keyword during transitions and other animation effects
* Only use color variables
